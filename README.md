# üåø Landscape-NLP

This repository provides the codebase for the paper:

> **Associations among park features, physical activities, and sensory perceptions from online reviews: a domain-specific named entity recognition model**

It includes tools for preprocessing landscape-related online reviews, applying stage-specific prompts, training NER models, and evaluating predictions within the domain of landscape and urban planning.

## üìÅ Repository Structure & Functionality

- `Data_process.ipynb`  
  A complete walkthrough for:
  - Converting raw `.csv` files (with review sentences) into JSON Lines format for model input
  - Parsing model predictions back to `.csv` for **manual verification**
  - Converting manually corrected `.csv` files into `json-spans` format for **model training**

- `Main prompts.ipynb`  
  A collection of few-shot prompts for:
  - Automatic annotation using GPT-4
  - Enhancing lexicon-based classification performance
  - Selecting sentences that contain underrepresented entities
    
- Model training & prediction scripts are built on top of [AdaSeq](https://github.com/modelscope/AdaSeq).

## üì¶ Data Availability
To comply with platform fair-use policies, we do not release the full dataset. Instead, we provide a representative sample of 100 annotated sentences (test100.json) for demonstration purposes.

## üß© Reproducibility Checklist
The unified script run_all.sh installs the environment, executes grid search training based on the specified YAML configuration, and logs results for full reproducibility. Dataset splits follow a GroupKFold-by-park strategy to prevent lexical leakage across folds.
